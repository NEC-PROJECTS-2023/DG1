Introduction:
The kidney is a crucial organ in the human body that serves important purposes. Kidney disease is a problem that is currently affecting the entire world now, however it is exceedingly difficult to anticipate, identify, and treat the disease. A good feature-based prediction model for identifying renal disease is provided by this study. On the basis of a dataset with several attributes, including Haemoglobin, Specific Gravity, Albumin, Red Blood Cells, Sugar Level, Blood Pressure, Age, and others, a model is built to forecast the disease. A model to predict whether a person has kidney illness or not was built using a variety of machine learning methods, including Nave Bayes (NB) and Random Forest.
